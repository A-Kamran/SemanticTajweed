### Ghunnah (Nasalization)

**Definition:**  
*Ghunnah* (غُنَّة) refers to a nasal sound produced during the pronunciation of certain Arabic letters, primarily **Meem (م)** and **Noon (ن)**, under specific phonetic conditions. It is a continuous, humming sound that resonates through the nasal cavity and is typically held for **two counts (harakahs)**.

**Linguistic Characteristics:**  
Ghunnah is an inherent feature of Meem and Noon when they appear with a **Shaddah (ّ)** — the diacritical mark indicating consonantal doubling. It is also an essential component of several Tajweed rules involving **Noon Sakinah** and **Tanween**, such as:

- **Idghaam with Ghunnah**
- **Ikhfaa**
- **Iqlab**

**Conditions Triggering Ghunnah:**

1. When **Meem (مّ)** or **Noon (نّ)** has a Shaddah.
2. When **Noon Sakinah (نْ)** or **Tanween (ــً, ــٍ, ــٌ)** is followed by specific letters:
   - **Idghaam with Ghunnah**: Followed by *ي، ن، م، و*
   - **Ikhfaa**: Followed by one of 15 Ikhfaa letters
   - **Iqlab**: Followed by *ب* (Ba)

**Examples:**
- **إِنَّ** (`inna`) → Noon with Shaddah pronounced with Ghunnah.
- **مِمَّا** (`mimma`) → Meem with Shaddah pronounced with Ghunnah.
- **مَن يُؤْمِنُ** (`man yu’minu`) → Noon Sakinah followed by Ya’ triggers Idghaam with Ghunnah.

**Function in Tajweed:**  
Ghunnah contributes to the fluency, clarity, and aesthetic quality of Quranic recitation. Correct application is critical for preserving the phonetic authenticity and melodic flow of the Quran.
